// TODO add a check to ensure a photo file actually exist when exporting - it should of course
// Also add check to upload to check that file exists after user saves because of one instance
// where a file was not actually saved -eg Nigel Beresford example
//
// Also look at cleaning up the export file name to remove nuisance characters like quotes and slashes
// are not good candidates for filenames
